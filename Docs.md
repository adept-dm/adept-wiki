Adept is split into separate sub-projects.

If you need to build or want to contributing, read about it [here](/adept-dm/adept/wiki/Contribute).

### Adept Core (adept-core)
Adept-core contains the core [models](http://adept-dm.github.io/adept/scaladoc/adept-core/index.html#adept.core.models.package), the [main entry point] (http://adept-dm.github.io/adept/scaladoc/adept-core/index.html#adept.core.Adept) for the API and the core operations. The operations are private, to make it possible to change the logic without breaking the API.

Currently it also contains what is needed to [import from Ivy](http://adept-dm.github.io/adept/scaladoc/adept-core/index.html#adept.ivy.IvyImport$)

Scaladoc is available [here](http://adept-dm.github.io/adept/scaladoc/adept-core/index.html)

### Adept CLI (adept-cli)
This project contains command line interface (CLI)
Read about how to get started with the CLI [here](/adept-dm/adept/wiki/Design)

### Adept sbt (adept-sbt)
Unsurprisingly this project contains the plugin so that you can use Adept with sbt.
